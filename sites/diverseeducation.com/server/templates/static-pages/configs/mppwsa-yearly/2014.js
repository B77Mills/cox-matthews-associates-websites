For instance, cash incentives and institutional efforts such as LEAD are offered for degree completion. It’s no surprise, then, that the division’s guiding principles are professional development, diversity and inclusion.</p><p>Garrett shares, "Diversity and inclusion is very important here; we live in a small rural community and most of our students come from rural communities. We are intentional about our efforts to expose students and staff to the diversity of people on our campuses."</p><p>Commitment to diversity and inclusion involves helping staff understand the different types of students served and, consequently, the different types of approaches necessary for working effectively with diverse students. Staff within the division meet together twice per semester, while staff meetings are more frequent within offices or departments. Semester staff-wide meetings are for everyone, as Garrett explains: "Twice a semester all members of the Student Services staff — no matter if you’re a clerk, food service worker, or director — are invited to attend and talk about current trends, what’s happening in our legislature, meet new staff members, collectively establish our goals for the year and participate in a professional development opportunity." It’s this commitment to diversity and inclusion, for staff and students, that places ASUB among this year’s "30+ Promising Places to Work."</p>',

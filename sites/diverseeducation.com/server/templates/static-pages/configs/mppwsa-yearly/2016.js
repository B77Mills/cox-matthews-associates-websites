  description: 'This study was first commissioned by the American College Personnel Association (ACPA) and <i>Diverse: Issues In Higher Education</i> in 2011. The national survey is administered by the Center for Higher Education Enterprise (CHEE) at The Ohio State University, which is directed by professor Terrell Strayhorn. Among other things, Strayhorn served as ACPA director of research and scholarship from 2009 to 2012.<p>The purpose of this commissioned study was to examine the extent to which diversity and inclusion permeates aspects (e.g., administrative structures, commitments, work environments, staffing practices) of various divisions of student affairs (or equivalent) at participating ACPA-member institutions across the globe.</p>',
  chee: 'The Center for Higher Education Enterprise (CHEE) is an interdisciplinary research and policy center that promotes the important role postsecondary education plays in global society, especially the vital roles and responsibilities of public higher education. CHEE is committed to improving student success by conducting distinctive research, policy analysis and outreach that will help make higher education more accessible, affordable, engaged and all-around excellent.<p>CHEE’s mission is to become the country’s preeminent higher education research and policy center, solving issues of national significance.

  promisingPractices: 'New to the 2016 edition of Most Promising Places to Work in Student Affairs, we highlight specific actions, initiatives, practices and programs identified by student affairs practitioners as important to their recruitment to and/or retention on this year’s list of promising places to work. After notification of their selection as a promising place to work, each senior student affairs officer (SSAO) was invited to provide contact information for three to five student affairs practitioners at their institution who could share insight into institutional and divisional practices that they believe make working at their respective institution a promising place for student affairs professionals. Based on our conversations with student affairs practitioners with as few as three months to as many as 25 years of professional experience, we found that student affairs professionals generally enjoyed working in student affairs units where five practices were experienced: demonstrated commitment to institutional mission and strategic plan; senior student affairs leaders who were available and involved; formal and informal recognition of good work; institutional and senior leadership support of work/life balance; and intentional investment in the development of student affairs staff.',
  biographies: '<b>Dr. Terrell Lamont Strayhorn</b> (principal investigator) is a professor of higher education at The Ohio State University, where he also serves as director of the Center for Higher Education Enterprise(CHEE). Author of 10 books, more than 100 journal articles and book chapters, more than 150 papers at international and national conferences and more than 200 keynotes, Strayhorn is a prolific scholar, internationally known student success expert, highly sought public speaker and was named on of the top scholars in his field by <i>Diverse: Issues In Higher Education</i> in 2011.<p><b>Dr. Derrick L.

Author of several journal articles and book chapters, his research interests consider three primary aspects of higher education: leadership and organizational socialization of administrators; minority-serving institutions; and the impact of identity intersections on academic and social experiences of college students with specific consideration of race, gender, sexuality and spirituality as social identities.</p><p>In addition to the principal investigator and project coordinator, the project benefited from the contributions of other CHEE staff who helped contact administrators, craft institutional profiles and elicit quotations. These include (in alphabetical order): Kristin Gebhart, Trevion Henderson, Alesia Howard and Christopher Travers.</p>',

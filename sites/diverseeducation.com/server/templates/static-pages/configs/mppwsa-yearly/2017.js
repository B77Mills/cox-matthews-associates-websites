  promisingPractices: 'Building on the success of last year, we are excited to include another set of "promising practices" in this year’s report for Most Promising Places to Work in Student Affairs 2017. As the MPPWSA project matures each year, we learn more and more about what’s going on at various institutions to increase staff diversity, foster a sense of belonging and equip college student educators for their work with students. In last year’s edition of <i>Diverse</i>, we shared five practices that hold promise for achieving the outcomes we desire with student affairs staff. This year we present four new promising practices.',

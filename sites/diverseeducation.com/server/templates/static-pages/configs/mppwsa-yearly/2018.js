  study: 'This study was first proposed by <b><i>Diverse: Issues In Higher Education</i></b> as a possible partnership with the American College Personnel Association (ACPA) in 2011.<p>Dr. Terrell Strayhorn was commissioned by ACPA and <i>Diverse: Issues In Higher Education</i> to serve as the project’s principal investigator. In this role, Strayhorn developed the Most Promising Places to Work in Student Affairs (MPPWSA) Survey in consultation with experts on the project’s advisory board. The original survey was pilot-tested with a small sample of non-ACPA member institutions; feedback from the pilot-test helped to clarify survey items, correct logic sequencing and determine the utility of our scoring algorithm.</p><p>The purpose of this commissioned study was to examine the extent to which diversity and inclusion permeates aspects of various divisions of student affairs (or equivalent) at participating ACPA-member institutions across the globe including administrative structures, commitments, work environments, and staffng practices.</p>',
